**Shortify** is a simple URL shortener app and services built upon **MEVN/VENoM** stack. It will convert your boring long URL into nice and simple eight-character *shorties* (that I like to call those short generated urls üòÅ). Not to mention they are unique for every new URL. It also keeps the history of your recent conversions. One click to copy and off you go!

## üöÄ Quick start with Docker
