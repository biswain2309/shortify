> A Simple url shortener App and services built upon **MEVN/VENoM** stack. It will convert your boring long url into nice and simple 8 character *shorties* (That i like to call those short generated urls üòÅ). Not to mention they are unique for every new url. It also keeps the history of your recent conversions. One click to copy and off you go.
